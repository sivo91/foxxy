        <h3 className='text-center my-5'>Foxxy was born twice in her short life.</h3>
        <br />

        <section className='px-2'>
           <p>In the bustling city of San Bernardino, within the somber walls of a shelter, a tale of rescue and compassion began to unfold. Foxxy, a dog with soulful eyes and a gentle spirit, found herself facing a grim fate. Scheduled for euthanasia by the cold morning of December 1st, her time was running out, her chances dwindling with each passing hour.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>But destiny had a different plan for Foxxy.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>Far away in Fairfield, in the early hour of Friday morning we made a decision . I woke up at 4 am,driven by  the silent pleas of helpless animals . The journey ahead was long  a daunting 6.5-hour drive to Los Angeles. But the thought of Foxxy waiting, unknowing of her looming fate, propelled me forward.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>The roads stretched endlessly as the sun began to ascend, casting its golden hues over the landscapes. Time was of the essence. The window for Foxxy&apos;s rescue would close at 11 am, a non-negotiable deadline set by the shelter. My heart raced with the ticking clock, the urgency mounting with each mile.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>Finally, at 11 am, the City of Angeles  and that shelter, a place where hope and despair often walked hand in hand, was in sight. 
          And here she was . No shine in her eyes, beaten spirit of a jailed soul.
          And nobody, nobody beside me came to her rescue. 
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>After a few formalities Foxxy was inside my car and slowly , slowly letting her goodness shine. Her head on my shoulder, then licking my ear we hit the long road ahead of us , stopping only to take bath . 
          No whine, no bark , silently letting me bathed her.
          In next few weeks she started to let other people in her life showing us affection, protection . She is a Velcro dog , loves to press her entire body against human while sleeps, she loves belly rubs and she gruntles softly when she is happy.
          She is a dog that likes to correct other dogs. She would be great for somebody who works from home , or is retired that can be with her . She thrives on love and adores her master and she needs it back. She whines a little when left alone but doesn&apos;t destroy things. 
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>Foxxy&apos;s tale is one of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest hours, there are caring people.</p>
