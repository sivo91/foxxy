Foxxy
Welcome to Foxxy website, a platform dedicated to finding a new loving family for my dog. This website is built using TypeScript and MongoDB and aims to connect people who are looking to adopt a dog with those who, regrettably, need to find their pet a new home.

About the Project
This project was born out of my personal need to find a new, caring family for my dog. The goal is to create a space where pet owners can share their stories and details about their dogs, and potential adopters can browse and find a new furry friend to welcome into their home.

How It Works
For Pet Owners: Share your pet's story, upload photos, and provide essential details to help potential adopters understand what makes your pet unique.
For Adopters: Browse through listings, read about each dog, and find the perfect match for your family.
Technologies Used
Frontend: TypeScript
Database: MongoDB
